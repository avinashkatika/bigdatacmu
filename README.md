Coursework
==========

This repository is mainly a static collection of assignments I completed for
various courses that are cool enough that I don't want to lose them. While I've
never lost a major assignment before submitting it, it has happened that 
the submission gets lost with time and hard drive changes and operating 
system reinstalls, and I occasionally come across a use case where having
that assignment handy would've been quite useful.

  Big Data course, Spring 2013. They're all in Java and involve various iterations
  towards implementing machine learning algorithms in the Hadoop framework.
