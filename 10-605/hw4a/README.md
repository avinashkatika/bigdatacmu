HW4a: Naive Bayes on Hadoop
===========================

This is a colleciton of Java files using the Hadoop framework to build a 
distributed version of the Naive Bayes classifier. It consists of four MR
tasks: two for training, one for joining the trained model to the test data,
and one for classification.
